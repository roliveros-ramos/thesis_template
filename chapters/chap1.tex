% how to calibrate an ecosystem model
An original Evolutionary Algorithm has been developed during the thesis for the purpose of calibrating complex stochastic models. The concepts and details are provided in section \ref{AHR-ES}.

This optimization algorithm and the tools related to the calibration of ecological models have been implemented in an R package, \texttt{calibrar}, which is also described in this chapter (manuscript 2).
